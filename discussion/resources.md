## Retelling The Tell-Tale Heart

Dr. Kenton Taylor Howard created a fictional recreation of Edgar Allan Poe’s classic short story, "The Tell-Tale Heart." He fully released a
1.0 version of the game in 2024 at the Foundations of Digital Games Conference and recently released a small update that provides all of the
game’s ink, CSS, and other related project files in a GitHub repository. The game includes code comments explaining how it works and can be used as an example of how to build a simple ink story.

## Inkle’s resources

Inkle has created multiple tutorials and learning materials:

- The basics tutorial is beginner-friendly and covers how to make a simple web-based game in inky and upload it to itch.io, a free indie game hosting site. [https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/)

- The writer’s manual is a full guide to ink. It is not beginner friendly, but covers nearly everything that can be done with ink: [https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md)

- Ink: The Official Guide is not free, but offers a print-based resource for ink / inky: [https://inklestudios.myshopify.com/products/ink-official-users-guide](https://inklestudios.myshopify.com/products/ink-official-users-guide)

## Book-length Works

Dr. Dan Cox and Dr. Kenton Taylor Howard created the unofficial ink cookbook in 2020. It is a bit older, but it is a free, extensive guide
to narrative scripting language ink: [https://github.com/videlais/Unofficial-Ink-Cookbook](https://github.com/videlais/Unofficial-Ink-Cookbook).

Dr. Kenton Taylor Howard discussed ink and Inky in his PhD dissertation,*Critical Modding: A Design Framework for Exploring Representation in
Games.* He created an associated digital game prototype, *Life in the Megapocalypse,* and provided much of the game’s source code in the
appendix of his dissertation. It does not provide a "how-to" guide, but may be of interest to educators and academics. You can find it here:

Dr. Dan Cox wrote a textbook covering ink and using the ink-Unity-integration plugin named [*Dynamic Story Scripting with the ink Scripting Language: Create dialogue and procedural storytelling systems for Unity projects*](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Story-Scripting-ink-Language/dp/1801819327), published in 2021.
