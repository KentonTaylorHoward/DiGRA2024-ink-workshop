# What this is â€“ and is not

This workshop does not attempt to cover every concept and pattern in the
ink scripting language. There are other, better resources for learning
these topics.

We also do not attempt to document and explain every method, function,
or node of each application programming interface (API) of the multiple
tools we include in this workshop. There are many advanced patterns we
cannot cover in a shorter time period, and even more needing a deeper
understanding not only of how ink works in very advanced ways, but also
how each individual programming language understands concepts in
connection to each other.
