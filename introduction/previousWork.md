# Previous and Future Work

This workshop is a refined and expanded version of two other, previous workshops. An early version of this workshop appeared as part of [NarraScope 2022](https://github.com/videlais/crash-course-on-ink-workshop-narrascope2022). This was then refined for a slightly different audience as part of [IAFA Online Conference 2022](https://github.com/KentonTaylorHoward/Crash-Course-On-Ink-VICFA-2022) the same year.

This current version of the workshop was expanded significantly to include additional tools and platforms. Content for the JavaScript API, ink-Unity API, and ink-Unreal API were added across several pages.

The authors of this workshop have also been refining content for upcoming courses and a longer book project. As such, this workshop covers many possible ways to work with ink across multiple tools in the hope specific sections could be incorporated into classroom material or used to teach certain topics or coding patterns when working with ink. Please feel free to use this material. And if you do, please let us know!
