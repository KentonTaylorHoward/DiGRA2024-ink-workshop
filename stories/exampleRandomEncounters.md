# Example: Random Encounters

Using multiple shuffle alternatives, random content can be created in an ink story. In this example, a simple random encounter is created from different parts as might be commonly found in a role-playing game or system.

```ink
As you enter the {~crumbling temple|ruined city}, you see {~two|three|four} {~rats|snakes|skeletons} in front of you.
```
