# Story Terms

**Project / Story**: When using the Inky editor, combining one or more files into a single work creates a *project*. At the same time, when the content is run, the term *story* is used. Generally, when discussing files, the better term is "project" and when describing its possible output or what a reader might see, the better term is "story."

**Flow**: Content runs downward. When a story is run, the beginning of the story appears at the top and the end of the story is at the bottom. The *flow* of the story continues until an end is encountered. Should the flow even "run out," an error will occur.

**Line**: The smallest unit of content in a project is a *line*. This is any content starting on a new line and continuing until the next new line.

**Comment:** A *comment* is any content appearing in a project as notes or instructions for authors. A comment is not story content and will not appear to a reader. Comment begins with two slashes, `//`, and ends with a new line.
