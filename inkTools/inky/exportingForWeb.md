# Exporting for Web

## Playable Story

From the Inky editor, File â†’ "Exporting for Web" is the simplest way to create and share a playable ink story. As part of the internal
processing, this action will create a compiled JSON version of the story, include some JavaScript code to run it, CSS to describe the style
of its presentation, and package everything together with an "index.html" file for easily opening and playing the story in a web browser.

## Playing the story

Playing the exported story is as simple as opening the created "index.html" file in a web browser.

As part of the packaging process, the JavaScript provided allows readers to perform common actions like restarting the story or saving their progress. Readers can also switch between visual themes to improve their reading experience.

## Sharing the story

Because the story is packaged with JavaScript and a HTML file, these files can be contained within a ".zip" file. Once done, the new file can be shared with anyone and played on other computers in their own web browsers.

The digital distribution site itch.io allows for hosting projects and games. An example of an ink story shared on itch.io is *Retelling the
Tell-Tale Heart* by [Kenton Taylor Howard](mailto:kenton.t.howard@gmail.com)
