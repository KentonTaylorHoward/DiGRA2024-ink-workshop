# Unity: Plugin Usage and Running Included Demo

## Downloading

The ink plugin for Unity can be downloaded in multiple ways, but we recommend using Open UPM([https://openupm.com/packages/com.inkle.ink-unity-integration/](https://openupm.com/packages/com.inkle.ink-unity-integration/)). While the plugin can be found on the Unity Asset Store, the version hosted there is often months behind the official version.

Other options can also be found on the GitHub Page for the plugin: [https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration](https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration)

## Installing

Installing the plugin can also be done in multiple ways, but we suggest following the manual installation instructions for installing the plugin via the Package Manage at [https://openupm.com/packages/com.inkle.ink-unity-integration/](https://openupm.com/packages/com.inkle.ink-unity-integration/). Click on "Manual Installation" and follow the text instructions.

## Accessing the Demo

**Note:** Because the plugin was originally created in a 2020 version of Unity, the plugin uses the legacy UI objects and not TextMeshPro, the
current and recommended UI toolkit for Unity.

The plugin includes a demonstration of how to use ink in a Unity project. The demo can be accessed by doing the following:

1. Navigating to the Packages/Ink/demos folder
1. Clicking the "Basic Demo" package file
1. Selecting "import" on the window that pops up
1. Navigating to the Assets/Ink/Demos/Basic Demo folder
1. Clicking on the "Basic Demo" scene file in that folder

## Accessing the documentation

Two documentation files are included: an ink for Unity package documentation file and a C# API documentation file. Both can be found by
navigating to the Packages/Ink/Documentation folder.
