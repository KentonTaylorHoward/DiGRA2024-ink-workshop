# ink Extension in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has many extensions for adding support for language syntax highlighting and other features. Among these extensions is one for using ink.

The "[ink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bruno-dias.ink)" extension adds support for most language concepts and keywords for more easily editing within VS Code itself. While it does not directly support compilation, it can be paired with other tools and services.
