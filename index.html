  <meta name="description" content="Narrative design is a vital aspect of many video game productions. Many large games include
  multiple endings, and even experimental projects contain branching paths. With this inclusion in
  many games, knowledge of common structures and patterns can help game developers
  implement their own plans and provide an insight to researchers investigating how concepts are
  used. This workshop focuses on the narrative scripting language ink used to create thousands of
  projects and award-winning games. As a language designed exclusively for narrative design, it
  allows for creating branching, looping, and dialogue structures for use across many video game
  genres.
  Beginning with presenting a collection of options, what ink names 'weaves,' this workshop
  moves from how to create simple branching structures into more advanced modular patterns. The
  language ink supports breaking a larger story into smaller parts and then moving between them.
  Through these multiple parts, looping patterns and use of dynamic sorting can be implemented,
  opening the ability to create many endings and simple story sorting to choose the best story
